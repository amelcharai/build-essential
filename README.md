# Build Essential

[![version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][circle-image]][circle-url] [![Docker Build Status][docker-image]][docker-url] 

> contains a list of packages which are considered essential for building packages in ci platform

## Why

Our [Reference Architecture] introduces a set of standards around linting, code quality, testing are more ...

Those standards are upheld using a variety of tools, however, projects need to add these individual tools as **dependencies**, which introduces a number of challanges:


### CI Environment

CI tests have to run `npm install` on every project, and the bigger the dependency list, the longer those runs take.

As part of moving to separate [CI & CD] processes, we have the opportunity to _pre-load_ some of the most common project dependencies into a [Docker container]

### Local Development

For developers working across multipl projects, having to install the same dependencies over and over for every project adds a layer of inconsistency that can be resolved with [global dependencies]

## What

- [npm package]: released as an open source package under `@telus` scope in npm, the [`package.json`][1] file contains a number of pre-selected common dependencies, _(mainly used for linting)_
  > _**Note**: the dependencies are marked as `peerDependencies` to enable some limitations around `eslint` and others in global usage._

- [Docker Container]: a [`Dockerfile`][2] uses the package above as basis for creating a container used in CI jobs


### Packages
  - Configration:
    - `@telus/eslint-config` - Shared [ESLint] Config
    - `@telus/remark-preset-lint-markdown` - Shared [Remark] Config
    - `@telus/semantic-release-config` - Shared [Semantic Release] Config
  - Tools:
    - `editorconfig-checker` - [EditorConfig] validator 
    - `eslint` - [ESLint] Validator
    - `node-release-lines` - Check if current Node.js is safe
    - `remark-cli` - [Remark] is a markdown validator
    - `semantic-release` [Semantic Release] is a fully automated version management and package publishing tool
    - `updated` - [Updated] ensures you have the latest dependencies 

  - Utilities:
    - [`install-peerdeps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps)
    - [`npm-run-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all)
## How

### Install Locally

```bash
npm install --global @telus/build-essential
```

> _**Note**: the [`postinstall`][6] step will attempt to install more packages **globally**, you might need to run with `sudo` depending on your local `npm` setup_


### Use in your CI

Use the [Docker Container][3] to run your [lint steps][5] as per the example provided in this project's [cirlce.yml][4]
